## Macro for the One Step From Eden game

Hi,

If like me you would like to use WASD as your movement controls and left/right/middle mouse as your spell controls (AFAIK this is not possible in the game but tell me if I'm wrong), I might have something for you :)

What it does:
- maps `left click` to `left arrow`
- maps `right click` to `right arrow`
- maps `scroll up` to `hold up arrow`
- maps `scroll down` to `stop holding up arrow`

Then assign Left/Right/Left/Right/Up as your Accept/Return/Spell 1/Spell 2/Weapon controls, and enjoy !
